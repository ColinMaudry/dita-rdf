<title>Generic topics</title>
<shortdesc>The element type &lt;topic> is the base topic type from
which all other topic types are   specialized. All topics have the
same basic structure. </shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p>For authors, typed content is preferred to support consistency
in writing and presentation to readers. The generic topic type should
only be used if authors are not trained in information    typing or
when a specialized topic type is inappropriate. <ph>The
OASIS DITA standard provides several specialized topic types, including
concept, task, and reference that are critical for technical content
development. </ph></p>
<p>For those pursuing specialization, new specialized topic types
should be specialized from appropriate ancestors to meet authoring
and output requirements. </p>
