<title>The conref attribute</title>
<shortdesc>This attribute is used to reference content that can be
reused. It allows reuse of DITA elements, including topic or map level
elements.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><p>The value of the <keyword>conref</keyword> attribute must
be a URI reference to a DITA       element. See <xref format="dita"
href="../archSpec/uri-based-addressing.dita#uri-based-addressing"></xref> for
details on specifying URI references to DITA elements. <ph>As
with other DITA references, a conref attribute that references a resource
without an ID is treated as a reference to the first topic or map
in the document.</ph></p><note>When using the conref attribute on
an element, the content of that element is ignored. For example, if
a phrase is marked up like this:<codeblock>&lt;ph conref="#topic/ph">Something&lt;/ph></codeblock><?Pub

the referenced &lt;ph> element.</note></section>
<!--RDA 20091211: Removed the following sections that explain syntax.
The information is already explained in the architectural spec
topic on URI based addressing.

<section><title>Using conref to refer to a topic</title><indexterm
id="att-conref-topic">conref attribute<indexterm>Reference to a topic</indexterm></indexterm><p>The
conref attribute may be specified on a topic element to pull in another
topic. For example, you could create a series of topics in a composite
(ditabase) document or nested context for authoring convenience and
then reference each topic individually into a new location. During
output processing, the referenced topics will be used at the point
of reference.</p><p>The conref value is a URI reference.</p><pre>Target
elsewhere in the same DITA document: 
  conref=&quot;#topicid&quot;
First topic in different DITA document: 
  conref=&quot;filename.dita&quot;
Specific topic in different DITA document: 
  conref=&quot;filename.dita#topicid&quot;</pre></section><section><title>Using
conref to refer to an element within a topic</title><indexterm
id="att-conref-element">conref attribute<indexterm>Reference to a
topic fragment</indexterm></indexterm><p>The conref attribute also
allows you to reuse content within a topic. For example, you could
create a &lt;note&gt; in a topic and then reference its ID (using
conref) from a &lt;note&gt; in another topic. This allows the content
of the note to be used in both locations.</p><p>The value
of conref is a URI reference that includes (or consists entirely of)
a fragment identifier consisting a number sign (&apos;#&apos;) followed
by the ID of the topic that contains the element that is referenced,
a slash (″/″), and the ID of the referenced element. If the URI reference
consists of only a fragment identifier, the referenced element must
be in the same XML document as the reference.</p><pre>Locally referenced
element: 
  conref=&quot;#topicid/elementid&quot;
In different document: 
  conref=&quot;filename.dita#topicid/elementid&quot;</pre></section><section> 
     <title>Using conref to refer to an element within a map</title><p><indexterm id="att-conref-topicref">conref attribute<indexterm>Reference
to a map             fragment</indexterm></indexterm>Within a map,
the conref attribute references an equivalent element in the same
map or another DITA document. The value of conref is a URI reference
that includes (or consists entirely of) a fragment identifier consisting
of the number sign (&apos;#&apos;) followed by the ID of the referenced
element. If the URI-reference consists of only a fragment identifier,
the referenced element must be in the same XML document as the reference.</p><p>Note
that if the conref attribute is used on the map element itself, the
attribute may only reference a complete map in another DITA document.</p> 
     <pre>Locally referenced element:
  conref=&quot;#elementID&quot;
In different document:
  conref=&quot;othermap.ditamap#elementID&quot;</pre></section>-->
<!--<section><title>Combining conref with conrefend to reuse
a sequence of elements</title><p><indexterm id="att-conref-topicref">conrefend
attribute</indexterm>Both the conref and conrefend attributes are
needed to reuse a sequence of elements. The conref attribute must
point to the first element in the sequence, while the conrefend attribute
points to the last element in the sequence. The first and last elements
must be peers and must be the same, although other elements may exist
between the start and end.</p></section>-->
