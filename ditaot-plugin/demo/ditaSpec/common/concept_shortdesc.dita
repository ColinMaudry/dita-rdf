 <title>Guidelines for concept short descriptions</title>
 <shortdesc>Always use the &lt;shortdesc> element in a concept topic. The short description must
  make sense both as the opening text of the topic and as pop-up text over a related
  link.</shortdesc>

   <title>What to say</title>
   <p id="cwhattosay">Introduce the concept and provide a concise answer to the question "What is
    this?" and in some cases "Why do I care about this?" If the concept is unfamiliar, you can start
    with a brief definition. Avoid using the short description to lead in or build up to a topic.
    The short description paragraph should contain the main point of the concept topic. The concept
    short description should clearly apply to a concept. Avoid turning the concept topic into a
    task. Do not simply repeat the title.</p>

   <p><b>Example of an effective short description</b><dl>
     <dlentry>
      <dt>Crawlers</dt>
      <dd>Crawlers are programs that search for information on the Web, in databases, or in other
       data sources. The information that the crawlers gather is added to the search engine index.
       Crawlers must run regularly to ensure that the search engine index is up to date.</dd>

   <p>The effective short description provides a more specific definition of crawlers and describes
    why crawlers are useful to search engine indexes.</p>

      <dt>Cube models</dt>
      <dd>
       <p>A cube model is a DB2 object that describes the data that is related to a collection of
        measures. The cube model groups relevant dimension objects around a facts object, creating a
        star schema or snowflake schema.</p>

      <dd>
       <p>A search collection is a set of data sources that users can search with a single query. A
        search collection can contain data from Web sites, file systems, and databases. You can
        build new collections or continue to update existing collections.</p>

      <dt>Types of spatial indexes</dt>
      <dd>Good query performance is related to having efficient indexes defined on the columns of
       the base tables in a database. The performance of the query is directly related to how
       quickly values in the column can be found during the query. Queries that use an index can
       execute more quickly and can provide a significant performance improvement.<p>This short
        description does not address the topic title, and it is too long. The topic is about spatial
        indexes, yet the short description discusses query performance. The writer might be using
        the short description to lead in or build up to a point. However, the short description
        should directly state the main point.</p></dd>

      <dt>Guidelines for writing a program for debugging</dt>
      <dd>You can make your programs easier to debug by following these simple guidelines: <p>Avoid
        adding a list or table lead-in sentence to a short description. You cannot add an &lt;ol> or
        &lt;ul> element inside a short description element. If you add a list or table lead-in
        sentence and then add the list or table to the next available element, the list or table
        will not be logically associated with the &lt;shortdesc> element. Such a structure is
        semantically incorrect. You will not be able to reuse the list or table with its lead-in
        sentence. Also, this short description will not make sense in pop-up text for a related
        link.</p></dd>
