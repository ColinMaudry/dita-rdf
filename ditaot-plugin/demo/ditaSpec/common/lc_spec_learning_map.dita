<title>Learning and training map domain elements</title>
<shortdesc>Use the learning and training map domain to organize groups of topics as learning objects. Defined as a map domain, these elements are available for use within any DITA map, not just a learning-specific DITA map. For example, you could include learning objects in a DITA generic map or in a DITA bookmap.</shortdesc>
