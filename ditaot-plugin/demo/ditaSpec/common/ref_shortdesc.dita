 <title>Guidelines for reference short descriptions</title>
 <shortdesc>Always use the &lt;shortdesc> element in a reference topic. The short description must
  make sense both as the opening text of the topic and as pop-up text over a related
  link.</shortdesc>

   <title>Length</title>
   <p id="rlength">Use one to three sentences or up to 50 words.</p>

  <section>
   <title>What to say</title>
   <p id="rwhattosay">Briefly describe what the reference item does, what it is, or what it is used
    for.</p>
   <p><b>Example of an ineffective short description</b>
    <dl>
     <dlentry>
      <dt>COUNT command</dt>
      <dd>DB2 Universal Database provides a COUNT command.</dd>
     </dlentry>
    </dl></p>
   <p>This short description states the obvious: that DB2 Universal Database provides this command.
    The short description does not tell users what the command is for.</p>
   <p><b>Example of an effective short description</b><dl>
     <dlentry>
      <dt><cmdname>COUNT</cmdname> command</dt>
      <dd>The <cmdname>COUNT</cmdname> command displays the current number of rows in the table. The
       rows are counted by the <cmdname>SQL SELECT COUNT(*)</cmdname> function.</dd>
     </dlentry>
    </dl></p>
   <p>This short description tells users what the command does and how the command works.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Phrasing</title>
   <p id="rphrasing">In most cases, use a complete sentence. You can use a sentence fragment only
    for a topic that is very short, such as an API topic and each of its subtopics. Use consistent
    phrasing across libraries and information centers so that your information can be seamlessly
    integrated with another product's information.</p>

  <section>
   <title>Examples of effective short descriptions</title>
   <p>Topic titles are in bold. Short descriptions are in plain text. Highlighting in a short
    description will not appear in the pop-up text over a related link.<dl>
     <dlentry>
      <dt><parmname>autostop</parmname> parameter</dt>
      <dd>Use the <parmname>autostop</parmname> parameter to direct a Q Apply program to stop
       automatically when there are no transactions to apply. Default:
       <parmname>autostop</parmname>=N.</dd>
     </dlentry>
     <dlentry>
      <dt>ejbdeploy command</dt>
      <dd>
       <p>The command to generate deployment code. If this command is run without any arguments, it
        displays a list of arguments that can be run with the command.</p>
      </dd>
     </dlentry>
     <dlentry>
      <dt>Metadata object rules</dt>
      <dd>
       <p>Three types of rules apply to metadata objects: base rules, cube model completeness rules,
        and optimization rules. These rules ensure that each object is valid both in and out of the
        context of a cube model and that effective SQL queries can be written and optimized.</p>
      </dd>
     </dlentry>
     <dlentry>
      <dt>WSDL service document</dt>
      <dd>
       <p>The WSDL service document groups a set of related ports together.Â The WSDL service
        document is equivalent to a business service that is published to a UDDI registry.</p>
      </dd>
     </dlentry>
     <dlentry>
      <dt><cmdname>MQReadXML</cmdname> function</dt>
      <dd>
       <p>The <cmdname>MQREADXML</cmdname> function returns XMLVARCHAR data from the MQSeries
        location that is specified by the <varname>receive-service</varname> option. The
         <cmdname>MQREADXML</cmdname> function does not remove messages from the queue that are
        associated with the <varname>receive-service</varname> option.</p>
      </dd>
     </dlentry>
     <dlentry>
      <dt>getValue method</dt>
      <dd>
       <p>Returns the value of the item specified.</p>

   <title>Examples of ineffective short descriptions</title>
   <p>Topic titles are in bold. Short descriptions are in plain text.<dl>
     <dlentry>
      <dt><parmname>autostop</parmname> parameter</dt>
      <dd>Lets you direct a Q Apply program to automatically stop when there are no transactions to
        apply.<p>Avoid phrasings such as <q>Lets you . . . .</q> in most IBM documentation. Also,
        the effective version of this example includes the default value.</p></dd>
     </dlentry>
     <dlentry>
      <dt>APIs for developing enterprise bean tools</dt>
      <dd>Several APIs are made available for developers who are developing enterprise bean
        tools.<p>This short description restates the topic title. It does not add useful
        information. The passive voice also makes it difficult to identify where or how the APIs
         <q>are made available.</q> This topic might also be better suited as concept topic, not a
        reference topic.</p></dd>
     </dlentry>
     <dlentry>
      <dt>Package com.ibm.faces.component</dt>
      <dd>Contains IBM JSF components. <p>This short description should provide more descriptive
        information about what the package contains and about the IBM JSF components.</p></dd>
     </dlentry>
     <dlentry>
      <dt>Metadata mappings between the Data Warehouse Center and CWM XML objects and
       properties</dt>
      <dd>The following table shows how Data Warehouse Center objects map to CWM XML objects, based
       on the Common Warehouse Metamodel (CWM) Specification, Version 1.0.<p>Avoid adding a list or
        table lead-in sentence to a short description. You cannot add an &lt;ol> or &lt;ul> element
        inside a short description element. If you add a list or table lead-in sentence and then add
        the list or table to the next available element, the list or table will not be logically
        associated with the &lt;shortdesc> element. Such a structure is semantically incorrect. You
        will not be able to reuse the list or table with its lead-in sentence. Also, this short
        description will not make sense in pop-up text for a related link.</p></dd>
