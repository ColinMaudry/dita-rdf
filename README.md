The DITA RDF project
====================

The objective of this project is to develop an ontology to describe DITA XML objects and to publish tools to generate RDF triples based on that ontology.

 - The ontology is already available as a Turtle file, dita.ttl
 - A DITA Open toolkit plugin will be created soon to enable the extraction of RDF triple from DITA content

The online version of the DITA RDF ontology can be found at http://purl.org/dita/ns# (this is also the base URI of the ontology).
