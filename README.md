The DITA RDF project
====================

The objective of this project is to develop an ontology to describe [DITA XML](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/DITA1.2-spec.html) objects and to publish tools to generate [RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) triples based on that ontology. In the end, it enables the publication of the metadata of a DITA documentation set to the Semantic Web and consequently its linking with other data types (product, people, sales, non-DITA document metadata, etc.).

The documentation of the project and its deliverables is published at [http://purl.org/dita/ditardf-project](http://purl.org/dita/ditardf-project).

##Public domain

The DITA RDF ontology, the DITA RDF plugin and all the code included in the DITA RDF project are free and released into the public domain, excepted the parts that were reused from the pdf2 DITA-OT plugin, developed by Idiom Inc.

See [UNLICENSE](UNLICENSE) for the whole shebang.

If you find the DITA RDF project useful, I would be grateful if you tweet about it (something like "Kudos to @CMaudry for the #DITA RDF project! http://purl.org/dita/ditardf-project #ditardf") or if you mention the origin and the author of this software in the documentation of your product.
