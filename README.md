The DITA RDF project
====================

The objective of this project is to develop an ontology to describe DITA XML objects and to publish tools to generate RDF triples based on that ontology.

 - The ontology is already available as a Turtle file, dita.ttl
 - A DITA Open toolkit plugin will be created soon to enable the extraction of RDF triple from DITA content
 - The plugin will then be adapted to be used in Componize for Alfresco

Useful links:
 - The online version of the DITA RDF ontology can be found at http://purl.org/dita/ns# (this is also the base URI of the ontology).
 - A graphical representation of the ontology can be viewed here: http://bit.ly/DitaRdfLucidChart
