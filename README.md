The DITA RDF project
====================

The objective of this project is to develop an ontology to describe DITA XML objects and to publish tools to generate RDF triples based on that ontology.

The online version of the DITA RDF ontology can be found at http://purl.org/dita/ns# (this is also the base URI of the ontology).
