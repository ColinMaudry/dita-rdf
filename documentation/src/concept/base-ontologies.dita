 <title>Base ontologies</title>
 <shortdesc>The ontologies from which the DITA RDF ontology is derived</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
		<p>I was originally using the Nepomuk ontologies <xref format="html" href="http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie" scope="external">NIE</xref> and <xref
				format="html" href="http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo" scope="external">NFO</xref>, and specialized the classes. The distinction they make between
			data objects (sequences of bytes) and information elements (interpretations) was very useful to make different statements about the files on the file systems and the
			semantics resulting from their interpretation.</p>
		<p>However, for the short term, I considered that these ontologies added more confusion to the users without bringing enough benefits.</p>
		<p>The DITA RDF ontology is consequently not based on other ontologies, excepting the references to <xref format="html"
				href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/?v=terms" scope="external">Dublin Core</xref>, inherited from the <xref format="html"
				href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/metadata-elements.html" scope="external">DITA specification</xref>.</p>
